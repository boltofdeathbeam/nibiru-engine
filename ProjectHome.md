Nibiru Engine is a library that helps create games for Windows and XBOX 360 using simple to use object oriented design. This is a hobby project that anyone is welcome to get interested in. All aspects of the library's objects attempt to be completely clear of specific game design influence. This allows the programmer to configure the objects to suit his or her game type, while focussing more on the game concepts themselves.


Nibiru is very simple and hopefully will one day be a powerful tool.
